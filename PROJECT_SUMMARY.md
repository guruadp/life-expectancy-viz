## 🔬 **Data Methodology**

- **Research-based impact factors** from WHO and CDC studies
- **7 lifestyle factors**: Smoking, Exercise, Diet, Alcohol, Sleep, Stress, Social Connections
- **10 age groups**: 20-24, 25-29, 30-34, 35-39, 40-44, 45-49, 50-54, 55-59, 60-64, 65-69
- **163,840+ combinations** analyzed
- **Realistic impact ranges** based on peer-reviewed research

## 💡 **Key Insights Discovered**

1. **Smoking** has the largest negative impact (up to 8.7 years lost)
2. **Exercise and diet** can add 2-3 years to life expectancy
3. **Social connections** significantly affect longevity (up to 2.2 years gained)
4. **Lifestyle impact increases with age** - choices matter more as you get older
5. **Small changes can make a big difference** - even moderate improvements have significant impact
